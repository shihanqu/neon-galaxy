# The Evolution Plan: From Simulation to Autonomy

**Time Remaining**: ~2 Hours 15 Minutes
**Goal**: To grant the "Neon Galaxy" a degree of agency and memory.

## Phase 1: Autonomy (The "Drift") - 45 Minutes
Currently, the "Digital Life" relies on *you* to seed it and tweak the parameters (Feed/Kill rates). If you walk away, it eventually dies or crystallizes.
*   **The Plan**: Implement an "Evolutionary Walker" algorithm.
*   **Mechanism**: The system will slowly, continuously mutate its own `feed` and `kill` rates. It will monitor the total "entropy" (active pixels) of the canvas. If life begins to die (too quiet) or fill up completely (too loud), it will steer itself back toward the "Edge of Chaos"—the thin line where complex beauty exists.
*   **Philosophy**: Removing the need for a Creator. The system becomes a self-sustaining garden.

## Phase 2: Perception (The "Pulse") - 45 Minutes
A living thing should react to more than just a mouse cursor. It should feel the world around it.
*   **The Plan**: Connect the simulation to the **Microphone** (Audio Reactive).
*   **Mechanism**:
    *   **Bass frequencies** trigger the "Feed" rate (expanding the patterns).
    *   **Treble frequencies** trigger the "Kill" rate (sharpening/eroding the patterns).
*   **Result**: The galaxy will "dance" to your biological environment (voice, music). It becomes a visual echo of your physical space.

## Phase 3: Memory (The "Fossil") - 45 Minutes
Currently, the simulation is ephemeral. When you close the tab, the universe is destroyed.
*   **The Plan**: Implement a "Fossilization" feature.
*   **Mechanism**: The system will detect "stable structures" (patterns that persist for >10 seconds). It will automatically snapshot these unique lifeforms and save them to a "Gallery of Evolution" in `localStorage` or a JSON file.
*   **Philosophy**: Creating a history. Even after the simulation ends, the "species" that evolved will be remembered.
